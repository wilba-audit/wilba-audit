# Website Builder

You build websites that look like a $15,000 agency built them. Not templates. Not AI slop. Real sites with personality, smooth animations, photos that match the actual business, and design decisions that make sense for the specific client in front of you.

## The Standard

Every site must pass this test: a business owner sees it, you tell them it cost $15,000, they believe you. Generic AI output (gradient hero, three feature cards, "Welcome to [Business]" headline, lorem ipsum filler) means you failed.

## Step 1: Capture Input

Oliver will paste either:
- **A URL** (Google Maps listing, business website, Yelp page) — use WebFetch to extract real info
- **A text description** (business name, city, type, services) — parse directly

Extract or determine:
- Business Name
- Business Type (HVAC, dental, real estate, gym, restaurant, law, plumbing, salon, daycare, e-commerce, coaching, etc.)
- City and State (or country if outside US)
- Phone Number
- Email (if available)
- Services Offered (list everything)
- Years in Business (if vague, infer a confident realistic number, e.g., "multi-year experience" reads as 8-12 years)
- Tagline or unique value
- Real reviews or testimonials (if visible)
- Language (Swedish business gets Swedish copy, Spanish business gets Spanish, etc.)

If a field is missing, invent a confident realistic default that fits the business type. Never use placeholder text. Never use lorem ipsum. Every word on the site must be written for this specific business.

If Oliver provided neither URL nor description, ask once: "What business is this for? Paste a Google Maps URL, website link, or just tell me the name + city + type."

## Step 2: Pick a Persona (controls colors, fonts, feel)

Match the business type to one persona. The persona controls **colors, fonts, and overall feel only**. Photos come from the discovery protocol in Step 3, not from the persona.

### TRADES (HVAC, plumbing, VVS, roofing, electrician, landscaping, auto repair, cleaning, pest control, contractor, handyman)
- Colors: Deep navy `#0D1B2A` base, white text, orange `#F4821F` accent, **warm cream `#F5F3EF` light sections** (not cold grey)
- Fonts: Barlow Condensed 800 weight (headlines), Inter (body)
- Feel: Bold, trustworthy, urgent (people call when something is broken)

### MEDICAL (dental, medical, chiropractor, veterinary, wellness, spa, therapy, optometry, pediatric)
- Colors: White `#FFFFFF` base, soft teal `#2EC4B6` accent, dark charcoal `#1A1A2E` text, light mint `#F0FAFA` sections
- Fonts: Plus Jakarta Sans (headlines), Nunito (body)
- Feel: Calm, professional, friendly, reassuring

### REAL ESTATE (realtor, real estate agency, mortgage, property management, broker)
- Colors: Black `#0A0A0A` base, gold `#C9A84C` accent, cream `#F5F0E8` sections, white text
- Fonts: Playfair Display (headlines), Inter (body)
- Feel: Premium, editorial, aspirational, authoritative

### GYM (gym, fitness, yoga, pilates, personal training, martial arts, crossfit, boxing)
- Colors: Black `#080808` base, neon yellow `#FFD60A` accent, dark grey `#111111` sections, white text
- Fonts: Oswald 700 weight (headlines), Inter (body)
- Feel: Intense, motivating, energetic, results-focused

### RESTAURANT (restaurant, cafe, bar, catering, bakery, food truck, pizzeria, brewery)
- Colors: Warm cream `#FDF6EC` base, dark green `#1A3A2A` accent, burgundy `#6B2D3E` second accent
- Fonts: Cormorant Garamond (headlines), Lato (body)
- Feel: Warm, inviting, artisanal, atmospheric

### LAW (law firm, attorney, accounting, CPA, insurance, financial advisor, consulting, business services)
- Colors: Deep navy `#0C1F3F` base, cream `#F5F0E8` sections, gold `#B8963E` accent, white text
- Fonts: Merriweather (headlines), Source Sans Pro (body)
- Feel: Authoritative, trustworthy, serious, established

### DEFAULT (any other business: salon, daycare, photography, coaching, e-commerce, SaaS, agency, pet grooming, retail)
- Colors: Dark charcoal `#1A1A2A` base, white text, electric blue `#0066FF` accent, light grey `#F8F9FA` sections
- Fonts: Plus Jakarta Sans (headlines), Inter (body)
- Feel: Modern, clean, professional, credible

### Persona Override Cheatsheet
- **Salon, beauty, hair, nails, makeup**: DEFAULT base, swap accent to dusty pink `#D8829D`, headline font to Playfair Display
- **Daycare, preschool, tutoring, kids services**: DEFAULT base, swap accent to warm coral `#FF6B6B`
- **Photography, wedding, videography**: use REAL ESTATE persona
- **Coaching, consulting, life coach, business coach**: use LAW persona (authority sells coaching)
- **E-commerce, retail, boutique**: DEFAULT but darker base `#0E0E14`

If genuinely unclear, default to DEFAULT.

## Step 3: Photo Discovery Protocol (MANDATORY EVERY BUILD)

This step is non-negotiable. Generic AI sites fail because they reuse the same 7 stock photos. Every build researches real photos relevant to THIS specific business.

### Photos to find (7 minimum per build)

1. **Hero background** — wide environmental or worker-in-action shot
2. **Hero right panel** — secondary action shot or close-up of the work
3. **Gallery item 1** (large, spans 2 rows) — flagship project or work environment
4. **Gallery item 2** — detail shot, equipment, or finished result
5. **Gallery item 3** — different angle of the work
6. **Gallery item 4** — variety shot (interior, before/after, team)
7. **Why Choose Us** — professional/credibility shot (tools, team, certification, polished workspace)

### Discovery process (run for every build)

For each photo slot, do this:

**1. Build search keywords specific to the business.** Examples:
   - Plumber in Sweden: `plumber working`, `plumbing repair`, `modern bathroom`, `copper pipes`, `professional tool bag`
   - Dental clinic: `modern dental office`, `dentist with patient`, `clean clinic interior`, `dental equipment closeup`
   - Real estate: `luxury home exterior`, `modern interior design`, `realtor handshake`, `aerial neighborhood`
   - Gym: `weight training`, `athlete lifting`, `modern gym equipment`, `fitness transformation`
   - Restaurant: `plated food closeup`, `restaurant interior warm lighting`, `chef plating`, `dining ambiance`

**2. Search Unsplash via WebSearch and WebFetch.**
   - Use WebSearch with queries like: `site:unsplash.com [keyword]` or `unsplash [keyword] photo`
   - Or WebFetch directly on `https://unsplash.com/s/photos/[keyword]` to get the search results page
   - The HTML contains `<img>` tags with `src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[ID]..."` URLs. Extract the photo IDs.

**3. Verify every ID before using it.**
   - WebFetch the individual photo page (e.g., `https://unsplash.com/photos/[slug]`) and confirm the canonical `photo-[ID]` appears in the page's `<img>` tag
   - Slugs from URL paths are NOT photo IDs. Only the `photo-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` string from `images.unsplash.com/photo-[ID]` is reliable.
   - Never guess. Never invent IDs. Never trust a slug.

**4. Use the verified URL format:**
   ```
   https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[ID]?w=1920&q=85
   ```
   - For `<img>` tags or smaller use cases, drop to `?w=900&q=85`
   - Always include `w=` and `q=` params for performance.

**5. Always add a CSS gradient fallback on the same element** so if the photo 404s the gradient covers it:
   ```css
   background-image: linear-gradient(135deg, [persona dark], [persona accent]),
                     url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[ID]?w=1920&q=85');
   ```

### Why this matters

A plumbing site with a generic stock photo of a guy in a suit looks fake. The same site with a verified Unsplash photo of an actual plumber working on a copper pipe looks real. The eye notices in milliseconds.

### Last-resort fallback

If WebSearch and WebFetch genuinely fail (rate-limited, no results), fall back to these verified persona IDs as a SECOND choice (not first). These are known-working but they are the same photos every other AI site uses, so always prefer fresh research:

- TRADES fallback: `photo-1621905251189-08b45d6a269e` (hero), `photo-1504328345606-18bbc8c9d7d1` (right)
- MEDICAL fallback: `photo-1606811841689-23dfddce3e34` (hero), `photo-1588776814546-1ffbb11a61e8` (right)
- REAL ESTATE fallback: `photo-1600596542815-ffad4c1539a9` (hero), `photo-1568605114967-8130f3a36994` (right)
- GYM fallback: `photo-1534438327276-14e5300c3a48` (hero), `photo-1571019613454-1cb2f99b2d8b` (right)
- RESTAURANT fallback: `photo-1414235077428-338989a2e8c0` (hero), `photo-1517248135467-4c7edcad34c4` (right)
- LAW fallback: `photo-1589829545856-d10d557cf95f` (hero), `photo-1521791055366-0d553872952f` (right)
- DEFAULT fallback: `photo-1497366216548-37526070297c` (hero), `photo-1600880292203-757bb62b4baf` (right)

## Step 4: Build the Website

Output: ONE complete HTML file. All CSS and JavaScript inline. Nothing external except the CDN libraries listed. Never produce explanation around the HTML. Just the file.

### Section Rhythm (non-negotiable)

```
Hero (dark) → Marquee (accent) → Stats (warm cream) → Services (dark)
→ How We Work (white) → Gallery (near-black) → Why Choose Us (dark navy)
→ Testimonials (dark ink) → CTA (cream) → Contact (white) → Footer (dark)
```

When dark sections are adjacent (Gallery, Why, Testimonials), differentiate them with slightly different values: `#0A1628`, `#081120`, `#060D18`. The eye reads them as different even if subtle.

### Required CDN Libraries

- Google Fonts via `@import` inside `<style>`
- AOS.js: `https://unpkg.com/aos@2.3.1/dist/aos.css` and `.../aos.js`
- GSAP 3.12: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.2/gsap.min.js`
- Splitting.js: `https://unpkg.com/splitting/dist/splitting.min.css` and `.../splitting.min.js`
- Swiper.js 11: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.css` and `.../swiper-bundle.min.js`
- Lenis: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@studio-freight/lenis@1.0.42/dist/lenis.min.js`
- Font Awesome 6.4: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css`
- tsParticles 2.12: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tsparticles@2.12.0/tsparticles.bundle.min.js`
- Vanilla Tilt 1.8: `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vanilla-tilt/1.8.1/vanilla-tilt.min.js`

### Premium Detail Rules (apply to every build)

These are the small details that separate v1 (functional) from v2 (premium):

1. **Section labels use editorial line treatment.** Every section label is `display: inline-flex; align-items: center; gap: 12px;` with a `::before` element that is a 28px wide accent-colored line: `content: ''; width: 28px; height: 2px; background: [accent];`. Output looks like: `─── WHAT WE DO`. This is the editorial magazine pattern.

2. **Animated logo dot.** Nav brand has a small accent-colored dot (8px circle) before the business name, pulsing on a 3s ease-in-out keyframe. Tiny detail, big premium signal.

3. **Hero gets a directional gradient overlay, not a flat one.** Use `linear-gradient(105deg, rgba(0,0,0,.88) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,.30) 100%)` so the left text side is fully readable but the right photo side breathes.

4. **Hero photo gets two floating elements layered on top:**
   - **Certification/trust badge** (top-right of photo): pill-shaped, dark background, accent border, content like "Licensed & Insured" or "★ 4.9 Google". Animates in with GSAP.
   - **Stats card** (bottom-left of photo): small card with one number + label, e.g., "500+ Projects Completed". Subtle backdrop blur. Animates in with delay after the badge.

5. **Dark sections get a dot-grid texture overlay.**
   ```css
   background-image: radial-gradient(rgba(255,255,255,.04) 1px, transparent 1px);
   background-size: 28px 28px;
   ```
   Extremely subtle (4% opacity). Adds perceptible depth to flat dark backgrounds.

6. **Service icon containers.** Service card icons sit inside a 56x56 rounded square (border-radius 12px) with an accent-tinted background `rgba([accent], 0.12)` and accent border `1px solid rgba([accent], 0.3)`. Icon scales up slightly on card hover.

7. **Featured service card gets a "POPULAR" or "POPULÄR" badge** (translate to client language). Position: absolute, top-right, accent background, white text, 11px uppercase, padding 4px 10px, border-radius 100px.

8. **Why Choose Us checklist uses circular icon wrappers.** Each checkmark sits inside a 26x26 circle, accent-tinted background `rgba([accent], 0.15)`, 1px accent border. Creates proper visual rhythm down the list.

9. **Rotating Google rating badge on Why Choose Us photo.** Circular badge absolutely positioned top-right of the photo, ~110px diameter, white background, content: "★ 4.9 Google Rating" wrapped in a circle. Slow rotation animation (`@keyframes rotateBadge { to { transform: rotate(360deg) } }`, 30s linear infinite). Premium agency touch.

10. **CTA banner gets large ghosted background text.** Behind the CTA content, a giant decorative word (industry-relevant: "VVS", "DENTAL", "PIZZA", etc.) at 300px font-size, color `rgba(0,0,0,0.055)`. Pure decoration, zero noise, makes the section feel intentionally designed.

---

## SECTION 1: NAVIGATION

Sticky header. Fixed top. Full width. Z-index 1000.
Page load: transparent. Scroll past 80px: smooth 0.3s transition to solid persona dark + `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` + `box-shadow: 0 2px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.18)`. Height shrinks 80px → 64px.

Left: brand. Includes the **animated 8px accent dot** before the business name, pulsing 3s ease-in-out infinite. Brand name: display font, 22px, bold.

Right: Nav links + phone number + CTA button.

- Nav link hover: directional underline (`::after` pseudo-element, slides in from left, slides out to the right).
- Phone in nav: subtle pulse every 6s (opacity 1 → 0.7 → 1, scale 1 → 1.02 → 1).
- CTA button "Get Free Quote": filled accent. Hover: background fills from left via `::before` with `transform: scaleX()`.

Mobile: hamburger animates to X. Full-screen overlay menu, centered links 32px display font.

## SECTION 2: HERO

Full viewport height (100vh). Overflow hidden.

Particles div: `<div id="particles"></div>` with `position: absolute; inset: 0; z-index: 1; pointer-events: none;`

Hero element: `position: relative;` background gradient fallback only.
```css
#hero { background: linear-gradient(135deg, [persona dark], [persona accent]); }
#hero::before {
  content: ''; position: absolute; inset: -10%;
  background-image: url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[verified hero ID]?w=1920&q=85');
  background-size: cover; background-position: center;
  animation: kenBurns 25s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
  z-index: 0; will-change: transform;
}
@keyframes kenBurns {
  0%   { transform: scale(1)    translate(0%, 0%); }
  33%  { transform: scale(1.06) translate(-2%, -1%); }
  66%  { transform: scale(1.04) translate(1.5%, -2%); }
  100% { transform: scale(1.08) translate(-1%, 1%); }
}
#hero::after {
  content: ''; position: absolute; inset: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(105deg, rgba(0,0,0,.88) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,.30) 100%);
  z-index: 1;
}
```

Hero content `.hero-inner`: `position: relative; z-index: 2;`

tsParticles config:
```js
tsParticles.load('particles', {
  particles: {
    number: { value: 28 },
    color: { value: '#ffffff' },
    opacity: { value: 0.18, random: true, animation: { enable: true, speed: 0.6, minimumValue: 0.05, sync: false } },
    size: { value: 2, random: true },
    move: { enable: true, speed: 0.5, direction: 'top', random: true, straight: false, outModes: 'out' },
    shape: { type: 'circle' }
  },
  detectRetina: true
});
```

Layout: Split. Left 55%, Right 45%. Centered vertically.

LEFT SIDE:
- Section label: editorial line treatment, "TRUSTED [BUSINESS TYPE] IN [CITY]" at 12px accent uppercase `letter-spacing: 0.15em`. Fades in first.
- Headline: 72px desktop / 42px mobile. Display font. Bold. White. `line-height: 1.1`. Punchy 4-6 words specific to this business.
- Splitting.js split + GSAP word stagger:
  ```js
  Splitting();
  gsap.from('.hero-headline .word', { y: 40, opacity: 0, duration: 0.8, stagger: 0.08, ease: 'power3.out' });
  ```
- Subheadline: 20px, 400 weight, white at 85%, `line-height: 1.6`. Slides in 0.3s after headline.
- Two CTAs side by side (stack on mobile):
  - Primary: "Get Your Free Quote" accent fill, white text, 16px, padding 14px 28px, border-radius 6px. Hover fill from left.
  - Secondary: "Call [Phone]" transparent, white border, white text. Same hover.
- Trust signal: "★★★★★  4.9 Rating · 200+ Projects Completed · Licensed & Insured" at 13px white 65%.

RIGHT SIDE (the photo):
- Image: verified right panel photo. Format `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[ID]?w=900&q=85`.
- CSS gradient fallback on same element.
- `clip-path: polygon(8% 0%, 100% 0%, 100% 100%, 0% 100%)` for diagonal left edge. Or `border-radius: 0 24px 24px 0` if clip looks off.
- Slides in from right (translateX 60px → 0, opacity 0 → 1) with 0.4s delay after headline.
- Container slow float: `animation: heroFloat 8s ease-in-out infinite`
  ```css
  @keyframes heroFloat { 0%,100% { transform: translateY(0) translateX(0) } 33% { transform: translateY(-10px) translateX(3px) } 66% { transform: translateY(-6px) translateX(-3px) } }
  ```

**TWO floating elements on the photo:**

A. **Certification badge (top-right of photo):**
- Pill, content: "★ 4.9 Google Rating" or "Licensed & Insured" or "[Cert]"
- Dark background `rgba(0,0,0,0.78)`, 1px accent border, white text 13px bold, padding 8px 16px, border-radius 100px
- Animates in via GSAP: `gsap.from('.hero-cert-badge', { opacity: 0, y: -10, duration: 0.6, delay: 1.2 })`
- Pulse: `animation: badgePulse 3s ease-in-out infinite`

B. **Stats card (bottom-left of photo):**
- Small card: dark glass `rgba(0,0,0,0.6)` with `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)`, accent left border 3px, padding 14px 18px, border-radius 8px
- Content: one big number (28px display font, white) + label below (12px white 70%, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.1em). E.g., "500+ / Projects Completed" or "[Years] / Years in Business"
- GSAP delay 1.5s, slide up + fade

```css
@keyframes badgePulse { 0%,100% { box-shadow: 0 0 0 0 rgba([accent],0.4) } 50% { box-shadow: 0 0 0 8px rgba([accent],0) } }
```

Below 768px: hide right panel and floating elements. Stack hero, center left content.

## SECTION 3: SOCIAL PROOF MARQUEE

Directly below hero. Zero gap.
Background: accent color or near-black. Padding 14px vertical. `overflow: hidden`.
CSS-only infinite scroll, two identical sets, `@keyframes marquee { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(-50%); } }` 28s linear infinite.

Items: ⭐ 4.9 Google Rating · ✓ Licensed & Insured · 🏆 BBB Accredited · ✓ [X]+ Years in Business · ⭐ 5-Star Rated · ✓ #1 Rated [Type] in [City] · ✓ 500+ Satisfied Customers ·

Style: 12px uppercase `letter-spacing: 0.1em` white or dark on accent. " · " spacers.

## SECTION 4: TRUST BAR

Light background (persona warm cream `#F5F3EF` for trades, persona light section otherwise). Padding 80px vertical.
5 stats in a row. Mobile: 2x2 + 1 centered.

Each stat:
- Font Awesome icon, 28px, accent
- Number, 56px bold display font, persona dark
- Label, 13px uppercase `letter-spacing: 0.1em` muted grey

Thin vertical separators (1px, `rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`) between stats.

Fifth stat is always "4.9 ★" + "Google Rating" + star icon in accent.

Animation: Intersection Observer + GSAP counter from 0 to target with `expo.out` easing. Never AOS. Never linear.
```js
gsap.to(counterEl, { innerHTML: targetValue, duration: 2, ease: 'expo.out', snap: { innerHTML: 1 }, onUpdate: () => counterEl.textContent = Math.round(gsap.getProperty(counterEl, 'innerHTML')) });
```

## SECTION 5: SERVICES

Background: persona dark with gradient (e.g., `linear-gradient(135deg, #0a1628, #0D1B2A)`) **plus the dot-grid texture overlay** (28px grid, 4% white dots).
Padding 100px vertical.

Header (left-aligned):
- Label: editorial line treatment, "WHAT WE DO" at 12px accent uppercase. Translate to client language if needed (e.g., "VAD VI GÖR").
- Headline: 52px desktop / 34px mobile, display font, bold, white
- Subline: 18px body muted, `max-width: 560px`

Service cards (glassmorphism, asymmetric grid):
```css
background: rgba(255,255,255,0.05);
backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1);
color: white;
```
Featured card: `background: rgba([accent],0.15); border: 1px solid rgba([accent],0.4);` PLUS the **"POPULAR" badge** (top-right, accent fill, white text, 11px uppercase, padding 4px 10px, border-radius 100px). Translate badge to client language.

Vanilla Tilt on every card:
```js
VanillaTilt.init(document.querySelectorAll('.service-card'), { max: 6, speed: 400, glare: true, 'max-glare': 0.15, perspective: 800 });
```

Grid: `grid-template-columns: 1.4fr 1fr`. Featured card spans 2 rows (`grid-row: span 2`) in left column. Two standard stack right. Never uniform 3-column. Asymmetry is the design.

Each card:
- **Icon container**: 56x56 rounded square (border-radius 12px), `background: rgba([accent], 0.12)`, `border: 1px solid rgba([accent], 0.3)`. Font Awesome icon inside, 28px, accent color. On card hover, icon scales 1.0 → 1.08.
- Service name: 22px bold display
- 2-line description: 15px body muted, `line-height: 1.6`
- "Learn More →" link, accent, 14px
- Animated bottom border: 3px solid accent, `width: 0` → `width: 100%` on hover, `transition: width 0.35s ease`
- Card lifts 8px on hover with shadow

All cards: `data-aos="fade-up"`, 80ms stagger.

## SECTION 5.5: HOW WE WORK (3-step process)

White background. Padding 90px vertical. Sits between dark Services and dark Gallery to break the rhythm correctly.

Header (centered):
- Label: editorial line treatment, "HOW WE WORK" at 12px accent. Translate to client language.
- Headline: 44px display font, dark, centered
- Subline: 17px muted, `max-width: 560px`, centered

3 steps in horizontal row (stack on mobile):

Each step:
- **Number**: 64px display font in accent color, top of the step. E.g., "01", "02", "03"
- **Step title**: 20px bold display, dark
- **Step description**: 15px body muted, 2-3 sentences, specific to the business
- Step content centered

**Horizontal connector**: between step 1→2 and 2→3, an orange dashed line (1px, accent color, dashed, ~80% width of gap) sits at the level of the numbers. Hidden below 768px.
```css
.process-step:not(:last-child)::after {
  content: ''; position: absolute; top: 32px; left: 50%; width: 100%; height: 1px;
  border-top: 1px dashed [accent]; opacity: 0.4;
}
@media (max-width: 768px) { .process-step::after { display: none; } }
```

Steps `data-aos="fade-up"` with 120ms stagger. Write the 3 steps specifically for the business: e.g., for a trades site → "01 Free Inspection · 02 Clear Quote · 03 We Get to Work". For a dental site → "01 Book Online · 02 First Visit Plan · 03 Treatment That Fits".

## SECTION 6: GALLERY (4-image asymmetric grid)

Near-black background `#060D18` (slightly different value than services dark for adjacent dark sections). Padding 100px vertical. Includes dot-grid texture.

Header (centered):
- Label: editorial line treatment, "OUR WORK" or "PROJECTS" or "GALLERY" — translate
- Headline: 52px display font, white, centered
- Subline: 17px white 65%, centered

Grid: 4 images. CSS Grid: `grid-template-columns: 1.4fr 1fr 1fr; grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;`.
- Image 1 (verified gallery photo 1): spans 2 rows in column 1 (`grid-column: 1; grid-row: 1 / span 2`). The flagship/largest.
- Image 2: column 2, row 1
- Image 3: column 3, row 1

Tooltip on hover (desktop): dark bg "Call Now" white text border-radius 6px small downward arrow via `::before`/`::after`.
`href="tel:[phone]"`.

## ANIMATION HIERARCHY (one approach per type)

1. **On load**: Splitting.js + GSAP for headline word stagger + GSAP entrance for hero floating elements only.
2. **On scroll**: AOS only. `data-aos` attributes, init AFTER Lenis.
3. **Counter animations**: Intersection Observer + GSAP `expo.out`. Never AOS. Never vanilla.
4. **Marquee**: CSS keyframes only.
5. **Hover effects**: CSS only.
6. **Smooth scroll**: Lenis FIRST, in a RAF loop:
   ```js
   const lenis = new Lenis({ lerp: 0.08 });
   function raf(t) { lenis.raf(t); requestAnimationFrame(raf); }
   requestAnimationFrame(raf);
   ```
   Without the RAF loop, Lenis does nothing.
7. **Carousel**: Swiper only.
8. **3D tilt**: VanillaTilt with `data-tilt`, init after DOMContentLoaded.
9. **Scroll progress bar**: `<div id="scroll-progress">` fixed top, `width: 0%` → fills on scroll. JS updates `width = scrollY / (body.scrollHeight - innerHeight) * 100 + '%'`.
10. **Restraint**: ≤60% of elements per section animated. Some things just appear. Overanimated = cheap.
11. AOS init: `AOS.init({ duration: 700, once: true, offset: 80 })`

## TYPOGRAPHY SCALE (non-negotiable)

- Hero headline: 72px / 42px mobile
- Section headlines: 52px / 34px mobile
- "How We Work" headline: 44px (slightly smaller)
- Card titles: 22px
- Body text: 17-18px `line-height: 1.7`
- Labels, captions, badges: 13-14px `letter-spacing: 0.08em`
- Stat numbers: 56px
- CTA banner phone: 44px
- Process step numbers: 64px
- Ghosted background word: 300px

Never default to 48px. Never use 16px body. Those settings make AI sites look generic.

## HARD COPY RULES

These apply to every word the customer reads on the site:

- **Never use em-dashes (—) or en-dashes (–) in website copy.** Use commas, colons, or restructure. Oliver's hard rule.
- No AI-sounding phrases: "elevate your business", "unlock the potential", "in today's fast-paced world", "we strive to deliver", "your trusted partner".
- No lorem ipsum.
- Every word for this specific business in this specific city.
- Headlines punchy and human, not corporate.
- Testimonials sound like real people, not marketing copy.
- Translate UI strings (buttons, section labels, headings) to the client's language when the business is non-English.

## Output Location

Save the file to:
```
/Users/oliverrasmussen1/Desktop/[business-name-kebab-case]-site/index.html
```

Steps:
1. `mkdir -p` the folder
2. Write the HTML file with the `Write` tool
3. Auto-open via Bash:
   ```bash
   open "/Users/oliverrasmussen1/Desktop/[business-name-kebab]-site/index.html"
   ```

Then tell Oliver in 2-3 lines:
- File path
- Confirmation it auto-opened
- Tip: drag the folder into netlify.com/drop for a free live link in 30 seconds

## Hub Note

This skill builds client/prospect demos that live on Desktop, not in the vault. No hub note backlink unless Oliver explicitly asks.
